# Blockchain Using JavaScript (Ongoing Project)
This project is a blockchain-based application developed in JavaScript. It aims to provide functionalities for managing transactions and wallets within a decentralized network.

## Project Structure
1. block.js: Defines the structure and operations related to a block in the blockchain.
2. blockchain.js: Main blockchain class managing blocks and chain integrity.

3. transaction.js: Defines and processes transactions within the blockchain.
4. wallet.js: Manages individual wallets within the blockchain.
5. wallet-config.js: Configuration settings for wallet operations.
6. config.js: Configuration settings for the blockchain or application.
7. crypto-hash.js: Utility for hashing functions related to blockchain operations.
8. index.js: API endpoints for reading blockchain data and mining new blocks.
